# Highlights Panel
This plugin displays the markdown highlights within the currently active note in the side panel. The plugin's design and features were informed by Obsidian's native "Outline" plugin.

### Features
- Collects markdown highlights within the active file in the right sidebar.
- Allows clicking on a highlight to navigate to its location in the document.

### Future features
- Add a button to copy the selected highlight.
- Allow for searching through highlights.
- Allow for collection of highlights made using the HTML \<mark\> element.
- Add an additional view to contain all highlights in the vault (dependent on performance).
